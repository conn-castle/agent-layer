# Decisions

Note: This is an agent-layer memory file. It is primarily for agent use.

## Purpose
Record otherwise-lost rationale that materially constrains future work. Current architecture belongs in repository documentation; enforceable behavior belongs in code, tests, schemas, or configuration. Add an entry only when its future-guiding rationale cannot be recovered from those canonical sources. Importance alone does not justify duplicating a decision; omit routine choices and standard best practices.

## Format
- Keep entries brief and durable (avoid restating obvious defaults).
- Keep the oldest decisions near the top and add new entries at the bottom.
- Insert entries under `<!-- ENTRIES START -->`.
- Line 1 starts with `- Decision YYYY-MM-DD <id>:` and a short title.
- Lines 2–4 are indented by **4 spaces** and use `Key: Value`.
- Keep **exactly one blank line** between entries.
- If a decision is superseded, replace the old entry with the new one. Fold the old entry's tradeoff context into the new entry's `Reason` field when it is still valuable, then remove the old entry.
- Periodically consolidate: remove entries that are now self-evident from the codebase (the decision is embodied in code, tests, or docs and a reader would learn it without the log). When removing, verify the tradeoff information is not uniquely preserved in the log.

### Entry template
```text
- Decision YYYY-MM-DD short-slug: Short title
    Decision: <what was chosen>
    Reason: <why it was chosen>
    Tradeoffs: <what is gained and what is lost>
```
