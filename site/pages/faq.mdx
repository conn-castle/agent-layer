## What problem does Agent Layer solve?
It keeps instructions, slash commands, MCP servers, and approvals consistent across multiple agents by generating every client config from one repo-local source of truth.

If you run more than one client, Agent Layer prevents drift and gives you a single place to review or audit changes.

## Does Agent Layer install Claude/Codex/Gemini/VS Code?
No. Install client CLIs separately and ensure they are on your `PATH`.

## What do I edit vs what gets generated?
You edit `.agent-layer/`. Agent Layer generates client-specific outputs in each client's native format when you run `al sync` or `al <client>`.

Rule of thumb: generated files include:

- Instruction shims: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Agent config: `.mcp.json`, `.gemini/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.json`
- Codex config and skills: `.codex/`
- Antigravity skills: `.agent/skills/`
- VS Code integration: `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.vscode/prompts/`, and a managed block in `.vscode/settings.json`

If VS Code is enabled, Agent Layer also generates repo-local launchers under `.agent-layer/` (for example `open-vscode.command` and `open-vscode.app/`). These are kept untracked by `.agent-layer/.gitignore`.

For full detail, see [/docs/reference#sync](/docs/reference#sync).

## Why does Codex ask me to sign in again per repo?
The Codex VS Code extension reads `CODEX_HOME` at startup, and Agent Layer sets a repo-specific `CODEX_HOME` via its launchers. That means authentication is stored per repo. When you open VS Code with a different `CODEX_HOME`, you will need to reauthenticate. This is expected and keeps credentials isolated. A practical benefit is that you can use different Codex accounts across repositories, such as one for personal projects and one for work, without mixing credentials.

## Should we commit `.agent-layer/`?
By default it is gitignored, but teams can choose to commit it (except `.agent-layer/.env`).

- Commit when you want shared, stable behavior across the team.
- Keep it ignored for local-only experiments.

If you commit it, keep `.agent-layer/.gitignore` so launchers and backups stay untracked.

## Where do secrets go?
Secrets go in `.agent-layer/.env` and are always gitignored. Only variables with the `AL_` prefix are loaded from `.env`.

Your existing environment variables take precedence over `.env` entries.

## Does Agent Layer use the network?
Agent Layer itself uses the network for update checks and pinned-version downloads (unless `AL_NO_NETWORK=1` is set).

If you enable MCP servers, `al doctor` and your agents will also connect to those servers.

See [/security](/security) for a precise breakdown.

## Where should I ask for help?
Open a GitHub issue:

- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/conn-castle/agent-layer/issues)

If you're not sure whether something is a bug or "just usage", it's still fine to file an issue. Include your `al --version` and the output of `al doctor` (redact secrets).

See [/docs/troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting) for common fixes first.

## How do MCP servers work?
You define servers in `.agent-layer/config.toml`. Agent Layer runs exactly the command or URL you configure; it does not install runtimes for you.

If a server uses `npx` or `uvx`, you must have those tools installed.

## Why do MCP servers fail to start in VS Code on macOS?
If MCP servers that use `npx` fail to start, VS Code may not see a user-directory Node install. Install Node via Homebrew (`brew install node`) so GUI apps can find `node` and `npx`, and avoid per-user installs that only exist in shell profiles.

## Can I pin a repo to a specific version?
Yes. Set `.agent-layer/al.version` to `X.Y.Z` or `vX.Y.Z`, or pass `--version` to `al init`. You can temporarily override the pin with `AL_VERSION`.

See [/docs/concepts#version-pinning](/docs/concepts#version-pinning) for the full model and tradeoffs.

## How do I upgrade a pinned repo?
Upgrade the global CLI first, then upgrade the repo pin using `al init --version latest` (or an explicit version) and run `al` in the repo to dispatch to that pinned version.

For the full upgrade contract, compatibility guarantees, and release migration rules, see [/docs/upgrades](/docs/upgrades).

## What happens if I edit a generated file?
It will be overwritten the next time you run `al sync` or `al <client>`. Always edit the source files in `.agent-layer/` instead.

See [/docs/reference#sync](/docs/reference#sync) for what is considered generated.

## Can I disable the wizard?
Yes. Use `al init --no-wizard` to skip the prompt or run `al wizard` later if you change your mind.

See [/docs/reference#wizard](/docs/reference#wizard) for what it edits.

## Is this safe for teams with strict security requirements?
Yes, if you configure it accordingly. Set `approvals.mode` to limit automatic approvals, keep command allowlists tight, and enable only trusted MCP servers.

Agent Layer does not install or sandbox MCP servers. It runs exactly what you configure, which makes review and auditing straightforward.

## Does Agent Layer ever delete files?
Only if you explicitly run `al init --force`. That mode overwrites managed files and deletes unknown files under `.agent-layer` without prompts. Normal `al init` will prompt before changes when overwrite is enabled.
