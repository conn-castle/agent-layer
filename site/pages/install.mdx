# Install

Install once per machine. `al` is a global CLI on your `PATH`.

## Requirements

- A supported client installed separately (Gemini, Claude, Codex, VS Code, Antigravity)
- A shell with `al` available on `PATH`

Agent Layer does not install client CLIs for you.

:::note
If you manage multiple repos, you still install `al` only once. Each repo gets its own `.agent-layer/` config.
:::

## Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew install conn-castle/tap/agent-layer
```

## Script (macOS/Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/conn-castle/agent-layer/releases/latest/download/al-install.sh | bash
```

## Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
iwr -useb https://github.com/conn-castle/agent-layer/releases/latest/download/al-install.ps1 | iex
```

## Verify

```bash
al --version
```

## First run

```bash
cd /path/to/repo
al init
al gemini
```

`al init` seeds:

- `.agent-layer/` for configuration
- `docs/agent-layer/` for project memory
- a managed `.gitignore` block

By default, `al init` prompts to run the setup wizard. Skip it with `--no-wizard` if you prefer to configure manually.

:::tip
If you want to test safely, run `al init` in a scratch repo first.
:::

## Recommended next steps

- Edit `.agent-layer/instructions/` to set your team rules
- Review `.agent-layer/commands.allow` to keep approvals tight
- Enable only the MCP servers you trust

## Update

Update the global CLI:

- Homebrew: `brew upgrade conn-castle/tap/agent-layer`
- macOS/Linux script: re-run the install script above
- Windows: re-run the PowerShell install script above

If a repo is pinned, update `.agent-layer/al.version` to the new release and run `al` to download it.

:::caution
If you use `al init --force`, it overwrites managed files and deletes unknown files under `.agent-layer` without prompts.
