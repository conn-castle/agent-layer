# Contributing

Agent Layer is open source and contributions are welcome. The fastest way to help is to open an issue with a clear problem statement and an example.

## Where to start

- Bugs and feature requests: GitHub Issues
- Changes and fixes: open a PR against `main`
- Development workflow: https://github.com/conn-castle/agent-layer/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md

## What makes a great PR

- Scope is small and focused
- Behavior changes are covered by tests
- Docs are updated when user-facing behavior changes
- Commit messages explain the intent of the change

## Local workflow

The repo ships a repeatable workflow in `docs/agent-layer/COMMANDS.md`. Prefer those commands over ad-hoc local setups so CI behaves the same as your machine.

If you change templates under `internal/templates/`, re-run `al init` in a scratch repo to verify the seeded output.

## Design principles

- Keep the repo-local source of truth explicit
- Avoid introducing hidden defaults
- Fail fast when required inputs are missing
- Keep generated outputs deterministic

:::tip
If you improve the docs, include a before/after example. It helps reviewers validate impact quickly.
