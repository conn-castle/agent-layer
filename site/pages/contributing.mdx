description: How to contribute to Agent Layer.
---

Agent Layer is open source and contributions are welcome. If you're unsure where to start, open an issue with a clear problem statement and a small reproduction.

## Where to start

- Bugs, questions, and feature requests: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/conn-castle/agent-layer/issues)
- Code changes: open a PR against `main`
- Development workflow (setup, tooling, and commands): [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](https://github.com/conn-castle/agent-layer/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)

## What makes a great PR

- Scope is small and focused
- Behavior changes are covered by tests
- Docs are updated when user-facing behavior changes
- Upgrade-related behavior or guidance updates include corresponding changes to the canonical upgrade contract at `/docs/upgrades`
- Commit messages explain the intent (not just the mechanics)

## Local workflow

The repo is set up for deterministic outputs and CI-aligned tooling. For most changes:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
make dev
```

Run from: repo root

If you want a faster loop, use `make test` while you iterate and `make dev` before you open a PR.

## Template and sync changes

If you change anything under `internal/templates/` (or sync behavior), validate the seeded output by running `init` and `sync` against a scratch repo:

```bash
mkdir -p tmp/dev-repo
cd tmp/dev-repo
go run ../../cmd/al init
go run ../../cmd/al sync
```

Run from: repo root

This catches accidental drift in generated outputs before CI does.

## Documentation

The website content lives under:

- `site/docs/` (documentation pages)
- `site/pages/` (marketing and utility pages like Install, FAQ, Security)

Documentation-only PRs are welcome. If you're changing copy and structure only, you usually do not need any Go tooling beyond opening a PR.

## Design principles

- Keep the repo-local source of truth explicit
- Avoid introducing hidden defaults
- Fail fast when required inputs are missing
- Keep generated outputs deterministic

:::tip
If you improve the docs, include a before/after example. It helps reviewers validate impact quickly.
