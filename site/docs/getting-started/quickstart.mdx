title: Quick start
---

This quick start gets you from zero to a running agent in a repo.

## Prerequisites

- Install the Agent Layer CLI (`al`)
- Install the target client (Gemini, Claude, Codex, VS Code, Antigravity)

Agent Layer does not install client CLIs for you.

## 1) Install `al`

Pick one install method from [/install](/install) and verify:

```bash
al --version
```

## 2) Initialize a repo

Run `al init` from anywhere inside the repo:

```bash
cd /path/to/repo
al init
```

This seeds:

- `.agent-layer/` (your configuration)
- `docs/agent-layer/` (project memory)
- a managed `.gitignore` block

By default, `al init` will prompt to run the setup wizard. Skip it with `--no-wizard` if you want to configure manually.

:::note
`al init` is safe to run multiple times. Use `--overwrite` to review template diffs or `--force` to overwrite without prompts.
:::

## 3) Launch an agent

```bash
al gemini
```

Any client command (gemini/claude/codex/vscode/antigravity) will:

1. read `.agent-layer/`
2. sync client configs
3. launch the client

## 4) Customize behavior

Edit these files to make the agent behave the way you want:

- `.agent-layer/instructions/` for global rules and preferences
- `.agent-layer/slash-commands/` for reusable workflows
- `.agent-layer/commands.allow` to define approved shell command prefixes
- `.agent-layer/config.toml` for approvals, agent enablement, models, MCP servers, and warnings

## 5) Enable an MCP server (optional)

In `.agent-layer/config.toml`, set a server to `enabled = true` and add any required secrets in `.agent-layer/.env`:

```toml
[[mcp.servers]]
id = "context7"
enabled = true
transport = "stdio"
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
env = { CONTEXT7_API_KEY = "${AL_CONTEXT7_API_KEY}" }
```

```env
AL_CONTEXT7_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

If a server uses `npx` or `uvx`, make sure those runtimes are installed first. Then run `al sync` or launch a client again.

## 6) Run a health check

Once you have a client working, run:

```bash
al doctor
```

This validates configuration, checks for missing secrets, and probes enabled MCP servers.

## Next steps

- [Repo layout](./repo-layout) to understand generated files
- [Configuration](../reference/configuration) for all config options
- [MCP servers](../concepts/mcp-servers) for server details and client limits
