title: Repo layout
---

`al init` creates three buckets: configuration, project memory, and generated client files.

## Configuration (`.agent-layer/`)

`.agent-layer/` is your single source of truth. Edit these files directly.

Typical layout:

```text
.agent-layer/
  config.toml          # approvals, agents, models, MCP servers, warnings
  instructions/        # numbered instruction fragments
  slash-commands/      # one file per command
  commands.allow       # approved shell command prefixes
  al.version           # optional repo pin
  .env                 # secrets (always gitignored)
  .gitignore           # ignores repo-local launchers, backups, templates
  gitignore.block      # managed .gitignore block template
  tmp/                 # agent-only artifacts
```

## Project memory (`docs/agent-layer/`)

These files are referenced by default instructions and act as long-lived memory for the repo:

```text
docs/agent-layer/
  ISSUES.md
  BACKLOG.md
  ROADMAP.md
  DECISIONS.md
  COMMANDS.md
```

Teams can choose to commit these files or keep them local.

## Generated client outputs

Generated files live at the repo root and are gitignored by default:

```text
.gemini/
.claude/
.codex/
.vscode/
.mcp.json
AGENTS.md
```

These are derived outputs. Do not edit them directly.

:::caution
If you change generated files, those edits will be overwritten the next time you run `al sync` or `al <client>`.
:::

## Safe to delete

You can delete generated client outputs at any time. Running `al sync` or `al <client>` will recreate them from `.agent-layer/`.

## Git ignore defaults

`al init` installs a managed `.gitignore` block that ignores `.agent-layer/` and generated client configs. If your team decides to commit `.agent-layer/`, edit `.agent-layer/gitignore.block` and re-run `al init`.
