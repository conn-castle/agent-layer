title: Overview

Agent Layer keeps AI-assisted development consistent across tools by generating each client's required config from one repo-local source of truth.

Instead of maintaining separate settings for every agent, you edit `.agent-layer/` once and let `al` project those settings into whatever client you run.

## Mental model

- `.agent-layer/` is the only place you edit
- everything else is generated output
- `al <client>` always syncs before launch

This keeps instruction drift from creeping in as your team switches between tools.

## Core workflow

1. Install `al` once on your machine.
2. In each repo, run `al init` to seed `.agent-layer/` and `docs/agent-layer/`.
3. Edit `.agent-layer/` (instructions, slash commands, MCP servers, approvals).
4. Run `al <client>` to sync configs and launch the client.

## Canonical vs generated

| Type | Location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Canonical inputs | `.agent-layer/` | You edit these directly |
| Generated outputs | repo root | Safe to delete and regenerate |

## What you edit vs what gets generated

You edit:

- `.agent-layer/instructions/` for global rules and guidance
- `.agent-layer/slash-commands/` for reusable workflows
- `.agent-layer/config.toml` for approvals, agents, models, MCP servers, warnings
- `.agent-layer/commands.allow` for approved shell command prefixes
- `.agent-layer/.env` for secrets

Agent Layer generates:

- client-specific configs in native formats (`.gemini/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.vscode/`, `.mcp.json`, etc.)
- repo-local launchers for VS Code / Codex where needed

If you edit generated files, they will be overwritten the next time you run `al sync` or `al <client>`.

## Why this matters

Agent Layer exists for teams that:

- want consistent agent behavior across multiple tools
- are tired of syncing configs by hand
- need a single place to define instructions, approvals, and MCP servers
- want reproducible agent setup for every repo and every engineer

:::tip
If your agents behave inconsistently today, start by centralizing instructions and approvals in `.agent-layer/`.
