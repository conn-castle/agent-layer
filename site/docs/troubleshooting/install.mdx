title: Install troubleshooting

If `al` does not work after install, try the checks below.

## `al` not on PATH

- Verify install location:
  - Homebrew: `brew --prefix conn-castle/tap/agent-layer`
  - Script installs to a standard location for your OS
- Open a new terminal after install so your PATH refreshes.
- Run `which al` or `command -v al` to confirm it resolves.

## Missing client CLI

Agent Layer does not install Gemini, Claude, Codex, or VS Code. Install the target client CLI and ensure it is on your `PATH`.

## Pinned version cannot download

If `AL_NO_NETWORK=1` is set and the pinned version is not cached, `al` will fail. Either unset `AL_NO_NETWORK` temporarily or pre-populate the cache.

## Update checks fail in locked-down environments

`al init` and `al doctor` may warn if update checks are blocked by your network. This does not prevent normal use. Set `AL_NO_NETWORK=1` to disable update checks and downloads.

## Still stuck

Run `al doctor` and read the warnings. It will surface missing secrets, invalid config, and MCP connectivity issues.

:::note
If you run `al doctor` with no MCP servers enabled, it will still validate config and instructions.
