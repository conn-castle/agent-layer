This page is the canonical upgrade contract for Agent Layer.

It defines:
- upgrade event categories,
- compatibility guarantees,
- release-versioned migration rules,
- and the supported OS/shell capability matrix.

If guidance in other docs is shorter or summarized, this page is the source of truth.

## In this page

## Upgrade event model

Agent Layer classifies upgrade-impact changes into three categories:

| Category | Meaning | Expected user action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `safe auto` | Low-risk change that can be applied automatically without manual migration steps. | Usually none beyond normal verification (`al doctor`, test/lint workflow). |
| `needs review` | Change is likely safe but may interact with local customizations. | Review prompts/diffs and choose whether to apply updates. |
| `breaking/manual` | Change cannot be safely auto-migrated or may require explicit user decisions. | Follow release migration notes before proceeding. |

Qualification guidance:
- `safe auto`: formatting-only docs changes, additive defaults, or internal behavior fixes that do not require user input.
- `needs review`: template updates where local edits may conflict, workflow/instruction rewrites, generated file ownership boundary changes.
- `breaking/manual`: command/flag deprecations, required config schema moves, or behavior changes that require an explicit user-controlled migration step.

Current enforcement status:
- In Phase 10, this model is a published contract and release-labeling policy.
- Automated enforcement in CLI flows is planned for later upgrade-lifecycle phases.

## Compatibility guarantees

Agent Layer follows a sequential release-line guarantee:

- Guaranteed path: upgrade from `N-1` to `N` release lines only.
- Example: `0.6.x` to `0.7.x` is guaranteed.
- Non-guaranteed path: skipping release lines (for example `0.5.x` to `0.7.x`).

What "guaranteed" means:
- We provide documented migration guidance for the guaranteed path.
- We classify known upgrade-impact changes using the event model on this page.
- We aim to keep `al init`-based upgrade workflows predictable for that one-step path.

What it does not mean:
- It is not a guarantee that every repo custom state can be auto-migrated.
- It does not guarantee one-step upgrades for skipped release lines.

## Migration rules by release

Migration rules are published per release and versioned with docs/release notes.

| Target release | Supported source release lines | Event summary | Required manual actions | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `v0.7.0` | `0.6.x` | `breaking/manual`: Windows support removed (installer, launcher, release targets, code paths). `safe auto`: upgrade path hardening (pin recovery, init dispatch bypass, download progress/errors), upgrade contract published. | **Windows users:** Windows is no longer supported; remove `al-install.ps1` and `open-vscode.bat` if present and migrate to macOS or Linux. **All other users:** No manual action required; run `al init --version v0.7.0` to upgrade. | First release with published upgrade contract. |

How this table is maintained:
- Add or update a row for every release.
- If a release includes `breaking/manual` items, list exact required actions.
- If no special migration is needed, keep the row explicit to avoid ambiguity.

### Ownership baseline and manifest policy

Upgrade ownership classification is deterministic and offline:

- Release manifests are committed in-repo under `internal/templates/manifests/<version>.json`.
- Backfill manifests are committed for `v0.6.0`, `v0.6.1`, and `v0.7.0`.
- New releases must add a manifest for the new tag as part of release prep.
- Runtime upgrade planning does not call GitHub/tag APIs to infer ownership.

Repo-local baseline state is stored at:

- `.agent-layer/state/managed-baseline.json`

`al upgrade plan` compares local files against baseline evidence plus embedded manifests and emits `unknown_no_baseline` when ownership cannot be proven safely.

## OS and shell capability matrix

Windows is not supported.

| Surface | macOS | Linux | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Install via Homebrew | Supported | Supported | Requires Homebrew setup for platform. |
| Install via `al-install.sh` | Supported | Supported | Requires `curl` and `sha256sum` or `shasum`. |
| `al` CLI core commands | Supported | Supported | Includes `init`, `sync`, `doctor`, client launch commands. |
| VS Code launchers | Supported | Supported | macOS: `.app`/`.command`; Linux: `.desktop`/`.sh`. |
| Shell completion: `bash` | Supported | Supported | `al completion bash --install`. |
| Shell completion: `zsh` | Supported | Supported | `al completion zsh --install`; may require `fpath` setup. |
| Shell completion: `fish` | Supported | Supported | `al completion fish --install`. |

## Commitment level and limitations

This contract is intended to be explicit without over-promising:

- We commit to best-effort adherence to this model and guarantee scope.
- If we cannot fully meet a guarantee in a specific release, we will document the limitation clearly in release notes and migration guidance.
- When in doubt, prefer explicit communication over silent assumptions.
