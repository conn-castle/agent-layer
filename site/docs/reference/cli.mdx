This page documents the most common `al` commands and flags. For the full help output, run `al --help`.

## Command summary

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `al init` | seed `.agent-layer/` and project memory |
| `al sync` | regenerate client configs without launching |
| `al doctor` | validate config and probe MCP servers |
| `al wizard` | interactive setup for approvals and MCP |
| `al <client>` | sync and launch a client |

## Root

```bash
al --version
```

Prints the Agent Layer version and exits.

## Initialize

```bash
al init
```

Seeds `.agent-layer/`, `docs/agent-layer/`, and a managed `.gitignore` block.

Flags:

- `--no-wizard` - skip the interactive wizard prompt
- `--overwrite` - prompt before overwriting managed template files
- `--force` - overwrite managed files and delete unknown files under `.agent-layer` without prompts
- `--version X.Y.Z` - pin the repo to a specific release

:::caution
`--force` is destructive inside `.agent-layer/`. Use it only when you want to replace managed files and remove unknown ones.

## Sync

```bash
al sync
```

Regenerates client configs without launching a client.

## Launch a client

```bash
al gemini
al claude
al codex
al vscode
al antigravity
```

Each command syncs configs first, then launches the client.

## Doctor

```bash
al doctor
```

Runs health checks, validates configuration, checks for updates, and probes enabled MCP servers.

## Wizard

```bash
al wizard
```

Interactive setup for approvals, agents, models, MCP servers, and warnings.

## Shell completion (macOS/Linux)

```bash
al completion bash
al completion zsh
al completion fish
al completion zsh --install
```

`al completion <shell>` prints a completion script to stdout. The `--install` flag writes the script to the standard user location for that shell.

Windows completions are not supported.

## MCP prompt server

```bash
al mcp-prompts
```

Runs the internal MCP prompt server over stdio. This is normally launched automatically by the client.
