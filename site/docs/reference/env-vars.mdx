title: Environment variables
---

Agent Layer uses a small set of environment variables for versioning and offline behavior. It also loads secrets from `.agent-layer/.env`.

## Versioning and cache

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `AL_VERSION` | force a version (overrides the repo pin) |
| `AL_NO_NETWORK` | disable downloads |
| `AL_CACHE_DIR` | override the pinned-version cache directory |

These variables only affect version dispatch and downloads. Normal sync and launch remain local.

## Secrets from `.agent-layer/.env`

Only variables prefixed with `AL_` are loaded from `.agent-layer/.env`.

Rules:

- Your existing process environment takes precedence
- Empty values in `.env` are ignored
- `.env` is always gitignored

Example:

```env
AL_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token-here
AL_CONTEXT7_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

## Built-in placeholder

`${AL_REPO_ROOT}` is a built-in placeholder for the absolute repo root. Use it in MCP server command arguments or paths when you want runtime expansion.

Example:

```toml
[[mcp.servers]]
id = "filesystem"
enabled = true
transport = "stdio"
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "${AL_REPO_ROOT}"]
```
