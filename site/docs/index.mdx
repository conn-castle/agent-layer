# Agent Layer Docs

Welcome to the Agent Layer documentation. The best way to get started is to run the quickstart, then return to concepts and reference as you customize.

## Recommended path

1. Overview - understand the mental model and why this exists
2. Quick start - run your first agent
3. Repo layout - learn what gets generated and what stays canonical
4. Concepts - approvals, MCP servers, version pinning, memory
5. Reference - config, env vars, CLI

:::note
If Agent Layer saves you time, consider starring the repo. It helps new users find the project.
