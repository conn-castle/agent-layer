title: Project memory
---

Agent Layer seeds `docs/agent-layer/` as a place for repo-specific memory files. These files are meant to be long-lived, human-readable context that agents can reference.

## Default memory files

`al init` creates:

- `docs/agent-layer/ISSUES.md`
- `docs/agent-layer/BACKLOG.md`
- `docs/agent-layer/ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/agent-layer/DECISIONS.md`
- `docs/agent-layer/COMMANDS.md`

The default instructions reference these files, so agents know where to look for project context and workflow commands.

## What to commit

Teams can choose to commit these files or keep them local:

- Commit when you want shared, stable context across the team
- Ignore when you want per-developer notes only

:::note
If you commit them, treat these files as part of your project contract. Keep entries short and current.

## How memory is used

Agent Layer does not enforce how you use memory files. Instead, the instruction templates guide agents to read them before planning work, running commands, or making changes.

If you add your own memory files, update your instructions to point to them.

## Suggested patterns

- Keep entries short and actionable
- Record decisions once and link them from tasks
- Clear resolved issues so the memory stays trustworthy
